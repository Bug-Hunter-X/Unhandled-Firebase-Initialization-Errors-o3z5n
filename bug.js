The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the app isn't properly initialized. This can be due to missing configuration, incorrect import statements, or asynchronous initialization issues.  The error messages might be vague, making debugging difficult.  Example:
```javascript
// Incorrect initialization
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig); // firebaseConfig might be undefined or incorrect
firebase.auth().currentUser; // Attempting to access auth before initialization completes
```
